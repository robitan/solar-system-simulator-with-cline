# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Children often find it challenging to understand astronomical concepts through traditional learning methods. Abstract concepts like planetary motion, scale, and spatial relationships in the solar system can be difficult to grasp from static images or text alone.

## Solution

A 3D interactive solar system simulator that allows children to:

- Visualize the solar system in three dimensions
- Observe planetary motions and relationships
- Interact with celestial bodies to learn about them
- Engage with space concepts in a hands-on way

## User Experience Goals

### Target Users

- Primary: Children learning about astronomy
- Secondary: Educators using the tool for teaching
- Tertiary: Space enthusiasts of all ages

### Key Experience Principles

1. **Engaging**

   - Interactive 3D visualization
   - Smooth animations
   - Responsive controls
   - Visually appealing graphics

2. **Educational**
