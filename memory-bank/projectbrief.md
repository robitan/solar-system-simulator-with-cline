# Project Brief: Solar System Simulator

## Overview

An educational 3D solar system simulation application designed to help children learn about space in an engaging and interactive way. The project aims to combine scientific accuracy with an enjoyable user experience to make astronomy accessible and fun for young learners.

## Core Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- Built with Node.js and Three.js for 3D visualization
- Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment
- Version controlled using Git
- Hosted and distributed via GitHub

### Functional Requirements

1. 3D visualization of the solar system
2. Accurate planetary motions and relationships
3. Interactive elements for user engagement
4. Educational content delivery
5. Child-friendly user interface

### Quality Requirements

- Clean, maintainable code with clear documentation
- Consistent naming conventions and code structure
- Proper modularization and code reuse
- Clear comments and documentation
- No sensitive information in codebase
- Comprehensive README for setup and usage

## Project Goals

1. Create an engaging educational tool for children
2. Demonstrate accurate astronomical relationships
3. Provide an interactive learning experience
4. Maintain scientific accuracy while being accessible
5. Create a codebase that is easy to maintain and extend

## Out of Scope

- Automated testing
- Strict coding rules enforcement
- Complex deployment pipelines
- Remote git operations without explicit instruction

## Success Criteria

- Children can learn about the solar system through interaction
- Code is well-documented and maintainable
- Application runs consistently in Docker environment
- Project is suitable for public GitHub hosting
